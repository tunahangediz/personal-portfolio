# Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

A sexy mistake. Oh God, what have I done? Bender, quit destroying the universe! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.

I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Check it out, y'all. **Everyone who was invited is here.** _You know the worst thing about being a slave?_ They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

## Large bet on myself in round one.

Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

1. You know, I was God once.
2. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
3. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

### Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

We don't have a brig. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. You're going to do his laundry? Say what? No. We're on the top.

- OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
- Throw her in the brig.
- Bender, we're trying our best.

Pansy. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Shut up and take my money! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… Hello Morbo, how's the family?

Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Yeah, lots of people did. Noooooo! Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

Throw her in the brig. I had more, but you go ahead. I never loved you. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Guess again. Shut up and take my money! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.

Fatal. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Your best is an idiot! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

Belligerent and numerous. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Tell them I hate them. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Take me to your leader! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

We don't have a brig. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. I never loved you. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!
